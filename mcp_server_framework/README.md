  - `communication/`: Communication protocol foundations
  - `knowledge/`: Knowledge management base classes
  - `development/`: Development support infrastructure

- `extensions/`: Specialized server implementations
  - `neurolora/`: Neural communication processing
  - `code_assist/`: Intelligent code generation
  - `knowledge_graph/`: Semantic relationship mapping

- `integrations/`: External system connectors
  - `notion/`: Notion documentation integration
  - `github/`: Version control interaction
  - `gmail/`: Communication channel management

- `utils/`: Supporting utilities
  - `config/`: Dynamic configuration management
  - `logging/`: Advanced logging mechanisms
  - `security/`: Authentication and access control

- `tests/`: Comprehensive test suites
  - `unit/`: Individual component testing
  - `integration/`: Inter-server interaction tests
  - `performance/`: Scalability and performance evaluation

## Getting Started
1. Install Poetry: `pip install poetry`
2. Install dependencies: `poetry install`
3. Run orchestrator: `poetry run mcp-orchestrator`

## Development Principles
